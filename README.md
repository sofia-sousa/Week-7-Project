## Project Description
In this project we take the position of data scientists employed by a speedating company. 
The briefing is to develop a model that is able to predict if two persons match, according to some specified features.
It is used data from OpenML called 'Speed Dating', to develop a supervised machine learning model.
In the 'Speed Dating' Jupyter Notebook file it is possible to see the different steps of the model construction, with comments and explanations.

## Dataset
The dataset was imported from OpenML. According to the source, the data was collected from participants in experimental events from 2002 until 2004. On those events, participants had four-minute dates, at the end of which, they were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their dates according to some attributes. Besides this information, the dataset also includes data regarding self-perception, demographic characteristics, life-style and also preferences on a mate.
